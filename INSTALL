Installing SDL_bgi
------------------

Please make sure you have SDL2 development packages. On Debian, Ubuntu
and similar distributions, please install libsdl2-dev and its
dependencies.

To compile and install the SDL_bgi library:

  $ cd src
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

which will copy SDL_bgi.h to /usr/include/SDL2/, and libSDL_bgi.so to
/usr/lib.

To compile some test programs in the test/ directory:

  $ make test

To remove the library, do:

  $ cd src
  $ sudo make uninstall

Enjoy!
