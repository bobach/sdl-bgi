Installing SDL_bgi
------------------

Please make sure you have SDL 1.2 and SDL_gfx. On Ubuntu and similar
distributions, please install the packages libsdl1.2-dev,
libsdl2-gfx-dev, and their dependencies.

To compile and install the SDL_bgi library:

  cd src
  make
  sudo make install

which will copy SDL_bgi.h to /usr/include/SDL/, and libSDL_bgi.so to
/usr/lib.

To compile some test programs:

  make test

To remove the library, do:

  cd src
  sudo make uninstall

Enjoy!
