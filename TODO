SDL_BGI is basically a wrapper to SDL_gfx, which is an excellent
graphics library that provides most graphics functions. Unfortunately,
its pixel-level routines don't implement some features, such as XOR
plotting and line/fill patterns.

To make SDL_bgi a standalone library, the following should be done:

- write a putpixel() function that supports logical operators. All
graphics routines will be based on the new putpixel().

- reimplement routines like line(), circle(), ellipse(), ...

- implement some code for simple font handling.
