This is SDL_bgi, a graphics library based on SDL 1.2 and SDL_gfx.

SDL_bgi is largely compatible with BGI, the Borland Graphics Interface
that was the de-facto standard in PC graphics back in DOS days. It's
very easy to use, and it also provides extensions for RGB colours and
mouse support. It should run on any platform supported by SDL (only
tested in Linux).

Unlike other BGI-compatible libraries, the purpose of SDL_bgi is not
full compatibility with BGI. Rather, it is meant to be an easy
introduction to SDL-based graphics: SDL and BGI commands can be mixed
together. Some functions are purposely not implemented for performance
reasons: for instance, setactivepage()/setvisualpage().

You must have SDL and SDL_gfx to compile programs with SDL_bgi. Please
see examples in src/test/ directory. Time permitting, future releases
will be based on SDL only, or SDL2 only when it becomes less buggy.
