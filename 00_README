This is SDL_bgi, a graphics library based on SDL2. SDL_bgi provides
graphics primitives, and is much easier to use than SDL2.

SDL_bgi is (say) 99% compatible with BGI, the Borland Graphics
Interface that was the de facto standard in PC graphics back in DOS
days. It's pretty fast and very easy to use, and it also provides
extensions for RGB colours and mouse support. It should run on any
platform supported by SDL2; it was only tested in Linux, though.

Unlike other BGI-compatible libraries, the purpose of SDL_bgi is not
100% compatibility with BGI; rather, it is meant to be an easy
introduction to graphics. Some functions are still not implemented;
for instance, line and fill patterns. Obviously, native SDL2 functions
can be used in SDL_BGI programs.

Examples are provided in the src/test/ directory.

If you don't need BGI compatibility, I suggest that you check out
SDL_gfx, a graphics library more complete and more powerful than
SDL_bgi.
